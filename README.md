WhatsApp_tmk is a python library that enables TMK that can communicate with WhatsApp users.
The project started as the protocol engine behind [Wazapp for Meego](https://wiki.maemo.org/Wazapp) and
[OpenWA for BB10](https://www.lowyat.net/2013/5896/try-this-openwhatsapp-for-blackberry-10/). Now as a standalone
library it can be used to power any custom WhatsApp client.
